I'm still waiting to hear back from a group about working together, so may change this over the next couple of days. However, as of now, should I work alone, I would like to commit my semester project to following up on my final project for the previous class. It was for an interactive map of the building I work in, but very much expanded. In terms of a learning opportunity, I see it as asking about accessibility and what information students need to know in order to be able to more easily navigate a very confusing building. It would also give information to new students as to what can be found within the building and how to interact with individual departments. 

As is commented above, the learning problem I'm trying to solve is mostly practical: no one knows how to easily navigate our building. There are plenty of ways to solve that if we can give individual attention to each person, but that is not feasible. The hope with this app would be to allow more people to be able to experience the best of what the building has to offer from the very beginning and allow for less confusion. This app will feature navigation, information, room tours, reservations, and history to better connect everyone to the building.

The data I would want to capture from the users is most directly related to what spaces they search for the most and, in a section for suggestions, what they would like to see changed in the building. Hopefully, if gathered correctly, my team can learn from the data and have an analytics page that provides us with more information to easily implement new initiatives.

## Independent Study A: UX/UI design

Reading Garret's book on the Elements of User Experience was particularly helpful in terms of breaking down exactly what I was intending to do with the project and writing down all of the elements as suggested.
