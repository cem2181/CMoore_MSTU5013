This may seem familiar as it is kind of a continuation of my project from last semester with a bit of an upgrade. In terms of it being a "learning design", the primary element of learning is in seeing the rooms of the building, learning about their elments and (in the future) other things that can be done while in them. 

I wasn't able to implement all of the elements that I wanted to include from the beginning, but think that overall it's been a real learning experience and I made something that is a step up from what was there before using Riot and Firebase to create a more full-fledged product.

First off:

## Independent Study A: UX/UI design

Reading Garret's book on the Elements of User Experience was particularly helpful in terms of breaking down exactly what I was intending to do with the project and writing down all of the elements as suggested. 

- Know what you're building:
	- For my individual work, I'm building a wayfinding application. It's intended purpose is to aid in getting people from one room to another within the building. It should be easy to navigate and intuiative for the sake of anyone using it. 

- Know what you're not building: 
	- This is neither a virtual tour or a total website. It is also not intended to replace in-person assistance.

- Things the users say that they want: 
	- From coworkers:
		- Common directional questions for heavy traffic areas
		- Information on each of the rooms and the hours of departments
		- Links to specific departments' websites on their pages

- Things the users `actually` want:
	- A clear representation of the building 
	- Easy to navigate

- Things the users don't know they want: 
	- Simplicity at its core

I was able to implement some of this and really focused on making the navigation intuitve. While I wasn't able to incorporate all of the elements (or even all of the floorplans), keeping the simplicity and representation elements were important for me to achieve. From the landing page, the sidebar makes it fairly simple to select where to go next and once you click on an element in the floorplan, more details become evident. 

With more time and elements, some of this would probably have to change or there would have to be more routing to other pages. I'd also like to experiment with touch/mobile interfaces.

## Independent Study B: Bootstrap Essentials

The whole navigation sidebar is something that was a godsend from bootstrap. Hopefully I was able to implement it well using some of the tutorials and readings I studied, but there are probably some erroneous elements as usual. 

## Firebase

Firebase was ineteresting for me to try to implement as the event reservation system was something I thought could be useful, but especially if the user is able to see when something is booked. I couldn't quite figure that out, so any thoughts would be much appreciated. 

## That's All Folks! 

Thank you for a great summer! I learned so much it's almost hard to believe. On to more coding!
